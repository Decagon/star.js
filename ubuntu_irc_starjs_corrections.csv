|@Unit193: Which supported release of Xubuntu would be the best to install (if chosen) on a 15GB HDD? I'm asking because I only have approx. 3 chances to find a distro due to my limited amount of DVD-Rs|,|I'll try the current release first. I was running Lubuntu 11.10 (If I remember correctly), but Chromium wouldn't connect to the internet and so i decided to upgrade my RAM from 256MB to 1GB. Since that release of Lubuntu worked extremely well except for that, do you think that the current release should at least be fast enough for use as a second PC?
